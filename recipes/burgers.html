    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Burgers are among my favorite foods. Being an excellent blend of meat, bread, cheese
        and vegetables they are the perfect dish!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 small onion finely grated</li>
            <li>1 clove garlicminced</li>
            <li>1⁄2 of salt</li>
            <li>1⁄2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 lb medium ground beef</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
       <ol>
           <li>Lightly oil grill& heat BBQ to medium.</li>
           <li>Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients.</li>
           <li>Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.</li>
           <li>Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.</li>
           <li>Handle the meat as little as possible – the more you work it, the tougher it gets.</li>
           <li>Gently shape (don’t firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch thick.</li>
           <li>Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.</li>
           <li>Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 – 8 minutes per side.</li>
           <li>An instant read thermometer should read 160F.</li>
           <li>Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!</li>
           <li>Tuck into a warm crusty bun& add your favourite toppings.</li>
       </ol>
