    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1¼ (295 g) cups warm water</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons dry active yeast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil or butter, melted and cooled</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar or honey</li>
            <li>3¾ cups (450 g) jovial All-Purpose Einkorn Flour</li>
            <li>1¼ teaspoons sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
       <ol>
           <li>In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, oil or butter, sugar or honey. Stir until creamy.</li>
           <li>Measure the flour with a baking scale or spoon into a measuring cup, then add it on top of yeast mixture. Sprinkle the salt on top.</li>
           <li>Mix with a spatula or jovial's einkorn knead tool until the flour is absorbed and you have a wet, sticky dough.</li>
           <li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise for 45 minutes.</li>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Butter an 8½ x 4½-inch loaf pan.</li>
           <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. The dough will feel very sticky and wet, but try not to add more additional flour than what you have dusted the work surface with or you may find dry flour baked in the bread. Shape the dough into a loaf. A bowl scraper is a great tool to help with shaping the sticky dough.</li>
           <li>Place in the loaf pan, cover with oiled or buttered plastic wrap to inhibit the plastic from sticking the dough. Let rise for 30 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap.</li>
           <li>Bake for 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Let cool completely before slicing.</li>
       </ol>
