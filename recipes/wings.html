    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Chicken Wings</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Kg (4 pounds) chicken wings cut into drumettes and flats</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon aluminium free baking powder (NOT baking soda)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>Pinch of cracked pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Buffalo Sauce</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons honey, white sugar or brown sugar (adjust to suit your tastes)</li>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
       <ol>
           <li>Lightly oil grill& heat BBQ to medium.</li>
           <li>Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients.</li>
           <li>Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.</li>
           <li>Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.</li>
           <li>Handle the meat as little as possible – the more you work it, the tougher it gets.</li>
           <li>Gently shape (don’t firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch thick.</li>
           <li>Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.</li>
           <li>Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 – 8 minutes per side.</li>
           <li>An instant read thermometer should read 160F.</li>
           <li>Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!</li>
           <li>Tuck into a warm crusty bun& add your favourite toppings.</li>
       </ol>
